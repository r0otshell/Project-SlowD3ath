### What is it?
```
Project $lowD3ath is a Denial of Service toolkit, written in Haskell, that is designed
to abuse the TCP, UDP, and HTTP protocols. It's main target can be anything from a
computer/server on a LAN, to a top secret data server hosted by NASA.
						(we don't condone illegal activities)
```

### Project Plans
Well, our finished product as we have designed it should contain the following:

> **Definite:**
> * TCP/UDP Packet Flooding (any port)
> * HTTP/HTTPS Flooding
>
> **Experimental:**
> * SSH Server Denial of Service via Buffer Overflow
> * FTP Server Denial of Service via Buffer Overflow
